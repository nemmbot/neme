"""Targeted research pipeline for conditional stacking.

When base forecaster models disagree significantly, this module:
1. Extracts the crux of disagreement using a cheap analyzer model.
2. Runs a targeted web search via OpenAI native search to resolve it.

Also provides ``run_gap_fill_pass`` — an always-on second-pass that runs after
first-pass research. It identifies factual gaps in the first pass, drops the ones
the analyzer graded as not worth a search (``triage_gaps``), and resolves each
survivor via a parallel OpenAI native web search (OpenRouter, donated-key billed).
